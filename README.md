# To Do

A "To Do" app catering to my own preferred way of tracking tasks and routines. 

```
flutter run --flavor dev
flutter run --flavor prod --release

# to regenerate icons
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Things left  to do...

...until finished:

- clean slate feature
- - flagged section for tasks list
- ui fixes
- - add buttons are awful, redo 
- - pretty print json in export?
- - change flag for arrow up?
- configurable days ahead, 
- group tasks by category in task list
- refactor structure
- publish to play store

...someday maybe:

- animated loading bar for daily progress
