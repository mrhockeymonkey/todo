# To Do

A "To Do" app catering to my own preferred way of tracking tasks and routines. 

```
flutter run --flavour dev
flutter run --flavour prod --release
```

## Things left  to do

- configurable days ahead, 
- UI for categories is a bit rough
- Import/export categories
- address all vscode problems
- ui fixes
  - no callout on tab buttons
  - order tasks with "at some point" on top
- go through TODO's
- refactor structure
- scheduled routines (i.e. on 15th of every month)
- animated loading bar for daily progress
- rebrand (LifeAdminMgr) + publish to play store
