# To Do

A "To Do" app catering to my own preferred way of tracking tasks and routines. 

```
flutter run --flavor dev
flutter run --flavor prod --release
```

## Things left  to do...

...until finished:

- configurable days ahead, 
- refactor structure
- scheduled routines (i.e. on 15th of every month)
- icon
- publish to play store

...someday maybe:

- Import/export categories
- animated loading bar for daily progress
